"# FinalProject" for CSC311
Use machine learning model studied in this class to build machine learning algorithms to predict whether a student can correctly
answer a specific diagnostic question based on the student’s previous answers to other questions
and other students’ responses. 
Starter Code for Part A provided by Professor Roger Grosse.
Part B using classification and bottom line revision to improve the algorithm
